EZMC is a server management CLI for self-hosting Minecraft Java Edition with AWS Elastic Container Service. This project is essentially a wrapper around the AWS SDK and [vatertime/minecraft-spot-pricing](https://github.com/vatertime/minecraft-spot-pricing), a CloudFormation template for managing resources that provisions the [itzg/docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) Docker image ([direct]()).

Features:

- Useful [commands](#commands) for orchestrating containers with the AWS SDK
- Supports vanilla and modded servers
- [vatertime/minecraft-spot-pricing](https://github.com/vatertime/minecraft-spot-pricing) claims an inexpensive $10/mo for a server running full-time. However, it's recommended to `stop` the server when not in use to save money. Spot pricing is set to 5Â¢.

## Prerequisites

- [Sign up](https://aws.amazon.com/free) for AWS. Be sure to setup billing.
- [Setup the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
- Node.js v20+, `.nvmrc` is included

## Usage

```sh
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:jseashell/ezmc-cli.git
# install dependencies
npm install
# build the project
npm run build
# create your server
ezmc new s1
# after a short wait you'll see:
# server ip 168.192.0.1
```

## Infrastructure

Resources are provisioned using your default AWS CLI profile, falling back to `us-east-1` as a default region.

AWS Elastic Container Service is used to deploy the Minecraft image. EC2 instance(s) are spun up upon request and remain running until told to shutdown via the `stop` command (remove the server entirely with `rm`).

> Contributors are not responsible for any AWS costs incurred from using this CLI. Use at your own discretion.

Each "server" is given its own networking stack and ECS cluster for simple clean up -- keeps it ez. By default, your AWS account will be limited to 5 VPCs. With the default VPC, and assuming zero other provisioned resources, that means you can have a maximum of 4 servers operating simulateously.
